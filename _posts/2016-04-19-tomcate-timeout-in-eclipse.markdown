You should have the server configured for your project like below file structure.

![tomcat1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/tomcat1.png)

Then go to the server view:

![tomcat2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/tomcat2.png)

And then double click the server name, you will see the server property, and open the timeout, then you can set the timeout.

![tomcat3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/tomcat3.png)

End
