# KongziJS — Learning JavaScript the Interactive Way

Named after [Confucius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius) (孔子, Kǒngzǐ) — the great teacher — **KongziJS** is a JavaScript education project I built to make learning JS more hands-on and enjoyable.

👉 **[Try it live → kongzijs.github.io/kongzijs](https://kongzijs.github.io/kongzijs/)**

## Why I Built It

Learning JavaScript from docs alone is dry. Most tutorials walk you through concepts linearly, but you rarely get to _play_ with the code immediately in context. I wanted to build something that bridges that gap — a space where you read about a concept and immediately run it.

KongziJS is my answer to that: an interactive, in-browser JavaScript learning environment built as a modern React app deployed on GitHub Pages.

## What It Covers

The project is structured as a self-contained educational app that covers core JavaScript fundamentals in an interactive format. Topics include:

- Variables, types, and scope
- Functions and closures
- Promises and async/await
- Array methods and higher-order functions
- ES6+ modern syntax

Each section pairs clear explanations with **live, runnable code examples** so you can experiment in real time.

## Tech Stack

```
React         — UI and component model
Vite          — Fast build tool with instant HMR
GitHub Pages  — Zero-cost deployment via GitHub Actions
```

The entire app is a single-page React application with no backend — everything runs in the browser. This makes it trivially easy to share and use without any setup.

## Getting Started

You don't need to install anything. Just open the link:

```
https://kongzijs.github.io/kongzijs/
```

If you want to run it locally or contribute:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kongzijs/kongzijs.git
cd kongzijs
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Open Source

The project is open source on GitHub. If you're learning JavaScript and want a reference playground, or if you want to contribute examples — pull requests are very welcome.
